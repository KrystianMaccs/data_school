# Data School(Work In Progress)

This is an API for a Data School project built with Django Rest Framework (DRF). The API allows users to enroll in courses, complete lessons and quizzes, and track their progress. Instructors can create and manage courses, lessons, and quizzes, as well as view information about enrolled users.



Getting Started
---------------

To run the API locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data_school.git`
2.  Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
3.  Activate the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`
4.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5.  Set up the database: `python manage.py migrate`
6.  Create a superuser account: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
7.  Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`

Authentication
--------------

Authentication is required for most endpoints in the API. To authenticate, include an access token in the `Authorization` header of your request. The access token can be obtained by logging in to your account or registering a new account.
